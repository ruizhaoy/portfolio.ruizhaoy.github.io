        <h4>Game of Cribbage</h4>
        <p>The following project is the simplified version of the game called Cribbage. The game is played with a standard 52-card deck. During the game, two players are both dealt five cards from the deck according to specific rules. </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;">The technical part of this assignment was training to create nested lists to represent cards within the deck and each player's hand. 
            By creating functions <i>deal_card</i>, <i>score_hand</i> and <i>play</i> I was able to write a program that determines the winner based on specific input.

        <h4>Chemical Equations</h4>
        <p>In this project, I had to build a program that would check if a chemical equation, stored as a Python dictionary, is properly balanced.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;">The technical part of this assignment was manipulating lists and chemical formulas to balance the equation provided in the input.
            More information is available in the link below. I created 4 functions: <i>mol_form</i>, <i>expr_form</i>, <i>check_eqn_balance</i> and <i>find_unbalanced_atoms</i> to solve the problem. An explanation of each function is provided in Python file.

        <h4>Image Recognition Algorithm</h4>
        <p>The following program accepts the image as a set of numbers and returns the coordinates of the "corners" of the objects on the provided image.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;">This project allowed me to work with images and provided me with a better understanding of data analysis and how it can be used in various systems
            In the follosing file I created 4 functions: <i>rgb_to_grayscale</i>, <i>dot</i>, <i>extract_image_segment</i>, <i>kernel_filter</i> and <i>non_maxima_suppression</i> each working together to achieve common goal. An explanation of each function is provided in Python file.

        <h4>Wind Turbines</h4>
        <p>Another project I worked on is the program that allows users to determine if the objects (in this case - turbines) will be overlapping if placed in specific coordinates.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;">The interesting problem here was to come up with an algorithm that would manipulate data and determine if objects are overlapping, touching or at the safe distance. And if they could be moved around safely.</p>
