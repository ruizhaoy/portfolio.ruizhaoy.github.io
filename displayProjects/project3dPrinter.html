        <h3>3D Printer</h3>
        <p>The 3d printer project is the design project required in course MIE243. we aim to design a 3d printer to achieve high printing speed and printing quality at a toleratable price. in terms of accomplishing the objectives of the project, the leadscrew combination design is selected as our proposed design. the design is shown below, we applied a lead screw and ball screw to achieve the motion transformation from the rotational motion provided by the stepper motor to linear motion. And we picked 3 nozzles to achieve the high-speed requirement.</p>

        <p>During the process of the design, we met problems when designing the y-axis movement and solved them by analyzing the problem and researching. Our first version of the design is shown below, it is noticeable that there was only one stepper motor placed on one side of the y-axis while a rail is attached on the other side. Based on testing, we figured out that two sides of the y-axis were not able to cooperate successfully. After analyzing the problem and researching online, we decided that the ball screws need to be attached to the rail on both sides of the y-axis to make sure the x-axis can go back and force with the same speed. The problem analysis is important here. </p>
